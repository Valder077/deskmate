# deskmate
A deskmate to keep you company during your late night study sessions(or anytime really!), whenever and wherever. It contains 4 keys that do different things (two interact with the desk pet and two are for start/stopping the pomodoro timer and to reset it). It also has a keychain to suit your studying on the go needs. 

I wanted to make something that would motivate me to study even during times where im just studying alone late at night, to remind me to push through and hence i decided to make deskmate, since I thought it would be really cool and also something that I would find cute and useful.
